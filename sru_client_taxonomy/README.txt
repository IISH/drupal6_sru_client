Select a source field, and a destination vocabulary. On asset add/update this module will copy all terms from source field to destination vocabulary. Existing terms will be overwritten.

Changes to the asset will only be made while administering collections. During individual asset node edits the terms will be left unchanged.

The selected source field will not be shown on asset detail pages.

The source field should be a string of '/'-delimited terms.
